# Goal Emergence and Planning System

This module implements autonomous goal emergence and resource-constrained planning for the Godly AI framework, enabling the system to discover meaningful objectives from behavioral patterns.

## Quick Start

```python
from src.agents.planning import create_planning_system
import jax.numpy as jnp

# Create planning system
planner = create_planning_system(
    observation_dim=5,
    action_dim=3,
    max_active_goals=8
)

# Start planning episode
initial_obs = jnp.zeros(5)
initial_action = jnp.zeros(3)
planner.start_planning(initial_obs, initial_action)

# Planning step
obs = jnp.random.normal(jax.random.PRNGKey(42), (5,))
action = jnp.random.normal(jax.random.PRNGKey(43), (3,))
results = planner.step_planning(obs, action, reward=0.7)

print(f"Patterns recognized: {results['patterns_recognized']}")
print(f"Goals generated: {results['goals_generated']}")
print(f"Resource pressure: {results['resource_pressure']}")
```

## Goal Types

The system generates different types of goals based on pattern characteristics:

### Skill Acquisition Goals
- Generated from successful behavioral patterns
- Focus on competence development
- High priority for learning

### Exploration Goals  
- Generated from novel or uncertain patterns
- Drive discovery of new behaviors
- Medium priority for knowledge gain

### Pattern Completion Goals
- Generated from interrupted sequences
- Focus on behavioral consistency
- Medium priority for coherence

### Resource Optimization Goals
- Generated when resources are constrained
- Focus on efficiency improvements
- Priority based on resource pressure

    observation_dim=8,
    action_dim=4,
    pattern_memory_size=1000,
    max_active_goals=10,

    resource_update_interval=5.0
)
```

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Planning Loop
```python
planner = create_planning_system(obs_dim=5, action_dim=3)
planner.start_planning(initial_obs, initial_action)

for step in range(episode_length):
    obs, action, reward = environment.step()
    
    # Update planner
    results = planner.step_planning(obs, action, reward)
    
    # Check for new goals
    if results['goals_generated'] > 0:
        print(f"Generated {results['goals_generated']} new goals")
    
    # Get planning recommendations
    recommendations = planner.get_planning_recommendations(obs)
    
    # Execute recommended goal if available
    if recommendations['recommended_goal']:
        goal_id = recommendations['recommended_goal']['goal_id']
        execution_result = planner.execute_goal(goal_id)
        print(f"Executing goal: {goal_id}")

# End episode
summary = planner.end_planning_episode()
print(f"Planning efficiency: {summary['planning_effectiveness']}")
```

### Resource-Constrained Planning
```python
# Monitor resource pressure
def check_resources(planner):
    stats = planner.get_system_statistics()
    pressure = stats['resource_pressure']
    
    if pressure['computational_pressure'] > 0.8:
        print("High computational pressure - prioritizing efficiency goals")
        return True
    return False

# Adaptive goal selection based on resources
for step in range(episode_length):
    if check_resources(planner):
        # Focus on resource optimization
        recommendations = planner.get_planning_recommendations(obs)
        advice = recommendations['planning_advice']
        
        if "resource optimization" in advice:
            # Execute optimization goals first
            pass
```

### Pattern-Based Learning
```python
# Track pattern emergence
def on_pattern_recognized(pattern):
    print(f"New pattern: {pattern.pattern_type}")
    print(f"Frequency: {pattern.frequency}")
    print(f"Success rate: {pattern.success_rate}")
    
    # Adapt behavior based on pattern
    if pattern.success_rate > 0.8:
        print("High success pattern - generating skill goal")
    elif pattern.confidence < 0.5:
        print("Novel pattern - generating exploration goal")

# Monitor pattern recognition
planner.pattern_recognizer.set_callback(on_pattern_recognized)
```

## Integration Examples

### With Exploration System
```python
from src.agents.exploration import create_exploration_system

exploration = create_exploration_system(obs_dim=5)
planner = create_planning_system(obs_dim=5, action_dim=3)

# Coordinate exploration and planning
def coordinate_systems(obs, action, reward):
    # Update both systems
    exp_results = exploration.step_exploration(obs)
    plan_results = planner.step_planning(obs, action, reward)
    
    # Share information
    if exp_results['novelty_score'] > 0.7:
        # High novelty - inform planner
        planner.add_context({'high_novelty': True})
    
    if plan_results['goals_generated'] > 0:
        # New goals - inform exploration
        exploration.add_context({'new_goals': plan_results['goals_generated']})
    
    return exp_results, plan_results
```

### With Memory Systems
```python
from src.memory.episodic import EpisodicMemory

memory = EpisodicMemory(...)
planner = create_planning_system(...)

# Store planning experiences
def store_planning_data(pattern, goal, outcome):
    episode_data = {
        'pattern_id': pattern.pattern_id,
        'pattern_type': pattern.pattern_type,
        'goal_id': goal.goal_id,
        'goal_type': goal.goal_type.value,
        'success': outcome['overall_success'],
        'timestamp': time.time()
    }
    memory.store_episode(episode_data)

# Retrieve relevant patterns for goal generation
def get_relevant_patterns(current_context):
    similar_episodes = memory.retrieve_similar(current_context)
    return [ep for ep in similar_episodes if ep['success']]
```

## Performance Characteristics

| Component | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|-------|
| Pattern Recognition | O(n²) | O(n) | n = sequence length |
| Goal Formulation | O(p·g) | O(g) | p = patterns, g = goals |
| Resource Management | O(1) | O(r) | r = resource types |
| Planning System | O(n² + p·g) | O(n + g) | Combined complexity |

### Scalability Considerations

- **Pattern Memory**: Bounded by `pattern_memory_size` parameter
- **Goal Management**: Limited by `max_active_goals` setting  
- **Resource Tracking**: Constant time operations
- **Episode Length**: Linear scaling with bounded memory

## Testing

Run the planning system tests:
```bash
# Test goal emergence and planning
python -m pytest tests/test_goal_emergence_planning.py -v

# Test with coverage
python -m pytest tests/test_goal_emergence_planning.py --cov=src/agents/planning

# Test specific components
python -m pytest tests/test_goal_emergence_planning.py::TestPatternRecognizer -v
python -m pytest tests/test_goal_emergence_planning.py::TestGoalFormulator -v
```

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Autonomous Skill Discovery
```python
# Robot learning new manipulation skills
planner = create_planning_system(
    observation_dim=robot.sensor_dim,
    action_dim=robot.action_dim,
    min_pattern_frequency=2  # Sensitive to new patterns
)

while learning:
    obs, action, reward = robot.interact()
    results = planner.step_planning(obs, action, reward)
    
    # Check for skill acquisition goals
    recommendations = planner.get_planning_recommendations(obs)
    if recommendations['recommended_goal']:
        goal = recommendations['recommended_goal']
        if goal['goal_type'] == 'skill_acquisition':
            robot.focus_on_skill(goal['target_state'])
```

### 2. Curriculum Planning
```python
# Educational system with adaptive curriculum
curriculum_planner = create_planning_system(
    observation_dim=student_state_dim,
    action_dim=lesson_dim
)

for lesson in curriculum:
    student_response = lesson.teach(student)
    performance = lesson.evaluate(student_response)
    
    results = curriculum_planner.step_planning(
        observation=student.get_state(),
        action=lesson.get_features(),
        reward=performance
    )
    
    # Adapt curriculum based on patterns
    if results['patterns_recognized'] > 0:
        # Student showing consistent patterns
        recommendations = curriculum_planner.get_planning_recommendations(
            student.get_state()
        )
        
        next_lesson = curriculum.select_lesson(recommendations)
```

### 3. Multi-Agent Coordination
```python
# Coordinated planning among multiple agents
agents = [create_planning_system(obs_dim, act_dim) for _ in range(n_agents)]

def coordinate_planning(agents, environment):
    for agent in agents:
        obs, action, reward = agent.interact(environment)
        results = agent.step_planning(obs, action, reward)
        
        # Share successful patterns
        if results['goals_generated'] > 0:
            successful_patterns = agent.get_successful_patterns()
            for other_agent in agents:
                if other_agent != agent:
                    other_agent.incorporate_patterns(successful_patterns)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No Patterns Recognized**
- Lower `min_pattern_frequency` threshold
- Increase `pattern_memory_size`
- Check `pattern_similarity_threshold`
- Verify behavioral diversity

**Goals Not Generated**
- Check resource availability
- Verify pattern quality (frequency, success rate)
- Review goal formulation criteria
- Increase `max_active_goals`

**Resource Pressure Too High**
- Increase resource regeneration rates
- Optimize goal resource requirements
- Implement goal prioritization
- Monitor resource usage patterns

### Debug Information

```python
# Get detailed system state
stats = planner.get_system_statistics()
print(f"Active goals: {stats['goal_statistics']['active_goals']}")
print(f"Pattern count: {stats['pattern_statistics']['total_patterns']}")
print(f"Resource state: {stats['resource_state']}")

# Monitor pattern recognition
pattern_stats = planner.pattern_recognizer.get_pattern_statistics()
print(f"Pattern types: {pattern_stats['pattern_types']}")
print(f"Average success rate: {pattern_stats['avg_success_rate']}")

# Check goal formulation
goal_stats = planner.goal_formulator.get_goal_statistics()
print(f"Completion rate: {goal_stats['completion_rate']}")
print(f"Goal type distribution: {goal_stats['goal_types']}")
```

## Contributing

When contributing to the planning system:

1. **Maintain pattern recognition accuracy** - ensure new features don't degrade pattern detection
2. **Consider resource implications** - new goals should include resource requirements
3. **Test goal emergence** - verify that meaningful goals are generated from patterns
4. **Document goal types** - clearly specify when new goal types are appropriate
5. **Validate planning logic** - ensure recommendations are actionable and beneficial
